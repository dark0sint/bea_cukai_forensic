## Overview

**bea_cukai_forensic** is an open-source Python-based toolkit designed for digital forensic analysis of data related to Indonesian Customs (Bea Cukai). This tool assists investigators, researchers, and security professionals in extracting, parsing, and visualizing forensic evidence from customs-related files, such as transaction logs, shipment records, and digital artifacts. It focuses on automating the analysis of structured and unstructured data to uncover patterns, timelines, and anomalies in customs enforcement scenarios.

**Disclaimer**: This tool is intended for legitimate forensic, educational, and research purposes only. It should not be used for unauthorized access, illegal activities, or bypassing security measures. Always comply with local laws (e.g., Indonesia's UU ITE and customs regulations). The author is not responsible for misuse.

### Key Features
- **Data Parsing**: Extract metadata from common file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML, PDF) used in customs documentation.
- **Timeline Visualization**: Generate interactive timelines of events, such as shipment tracking or transaction histories.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Basic statistical analysis to flag unusual patterns (e.g., high-volume imports/exports).
- **Graph Visualization**: Network graphs for relationships between entities (e.g., importers, exporters, ports).
- **Report Generation**: Automated PDF/HTML reports with summaries and charts.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend for custom forensic modules.
